After obtaining the regions of interest (ROIs) from original dataset, the first step is to train our proposed deep fusion models on those ROI patches which are randomly collected from all ROIs. We proposed the deep fusion model (Model1) to directly fuse the deep features to classify the Normal and Tumor ROI patches. To explore the association among channels of the same block, we propose another deep fusion model (Model2) to integrate the cross-channel deep features using 1 × 1 convolution.

However, DPC may fail to identify clusters with multiple density peaks (multi-centers) and may not be able to identify natural clusters whose centers have relatively lower local density. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clustering algorithm based on a hierarchical approach, named multi-center density peak clustering (McDPC). Firstly, based on a widely adopted hypothesis that the potential cluster centers are relatively far away from each other. McDPC obtains centers of the initial micro-clusters (named representative data points) whose minimum distance to the other higher-density data points are relatively larger. Secondly, the representative data points are autonomously categorized into different density levels. Finally, McDPC deals with micro-clusters at each level and if necessary, merges the micro-clusters at a specific level into one cluster to identify multi-center clusters. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed McDPC algorithm, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets and benchmark the performance of McDPC against other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

Many existing clustering methods may still face the challenge in self-identifying clusters with varying shapes, sizes and densities.

The anchor points in APC are characterized by having a relatively large distance from data points with higher densities. We take anchor points as centers to obtain intermediate clusters, which can divide the whole dataset more appropriately so as to better facilitate further grouping. In essence, based on the analysis of the identified anchor points, the relationship among the corresponding intermediate clusters can be better revealed. In short, the difference in local densities (densities within neighboring data points) of the anchor points characterizes their different properties, that is to say, all the intermediate clusters may fall into one or multiple identified levels with different densities. Finally, based on the properties of anchor points, APC spontaneously chooses the appropriate clustering strategies and reports the final clustering results. To evaluate the performances of APC, we conduct experiments on twelve two-dimensional synthetic datasets and twelve multi-dimensional real-world datasets.

Recently, evolutionary computation (EC) has become an important approach for solving feature selection problems. However, firstly, as the datasets processed by classifiers become increasingly large and complex, more and more irrelevant and redundant features may exist and there may be more local optima in the large-scale feature space. Therefore, traditional EC algorithms which have only one candidate solution generation strategy (CSGS) with fixed parameter values may not perform well in searching for the optimal feature subsets for large-scale feature selection problems. Secondly, many existing studies usually use only one classifier to evaluate feature subsets. To show the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms for feature selection problems, more classifiers should be tested. Thus, in order to efficiently solve large-scale feature selection problems and to show whether the EC-based feature selection method is efficient for more classifiers, a self-adaptive parameter and strategy based particle swarm optimization (SPS-PSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper using multiple classifiers. In SPS-PSO, a representation scheme of solutions and five CSGSs have been used. To automatically adjust the CSGSs and their parameter values during the evolutionary process, a strategy self-adaptive mechanism and a parameter self-adaptive mechanism are employed in the framework of particle swarm optimization (PSO). By using the self-adaptive mechanisms, the SPS-PSO can adjust both CSGSs and their parameter values when solving different large-scale feature selection problems. Therefore, SPS-PSO has good global and local search ability when dealing with these large-scale problems. Moreover, four classifiers, i.e., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), extreme learning machine (ELM), and support vector machine (SVM), are individually used as the evaluation functions for testing the effectiveness of feature subsets generated by SPS-PSO. Nine datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Causality Workbench are used in the experiments. All the nine datasets have more than 600 dimensions, and two of them have more than 5,000 dimensions. The experimental results show that the strategy and parameter self-adaptive mechanisms can improve the performance of the evolutionary algorithms, and that SPS-PSO can achieve higher classification accuracy and obtain more concise solutions than those of the other algorithms on the large-scale feature problems selected in this research. In addition, feature selection can improve the classification accuracy and reduce computational time for various classifiers.

Firstly, MCSC obtains two different groups of clustering results from the same K-means algorithm because its initial centroids are randomly selected. Then, for one group, MCSC uses shared nearest neighbour information to calculate a label transition matrix, which denotes label transition probability between any two initial clusters. Each initial cluster may be reassigned if merging results after label transition satisfy a consensus function that maximizes structural matching degree of two different groups of clustering results. In essence, the MCSC may be interpreted as a label training process.

By modelling existing experimental data, predictive models can be built to forecast self-healing efficiency. This has the potential to reduce the time input required by laboratory experiments, guide material and component selection, and inform hypotheses, thereby facilitating the design of novel self-healing materials. In this position paper, we first present preliminary knowledge and quantitative definitions of the self-healing efficiency of materials. We then demonstrate several widely used machine learning approaches and review an experimental case of predictive modelling based on neural networks.

Recently, the density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm was proposed to discover the centers of clusters by finding the density peaks in a dataset based on their local densities. The DPC needs neither an iterative process nor a large number of parameters, and it supports a heuristic approach, known as the decision graph, to manually select cluster centroids. However, the selection of the key parameters of the DPC was not systematically investigated. In this paper, we propose the feasible residual error-based density peak clustering algorithm with the fragment merging strategy, where the local density within the neighborhood region is measured through the residual error computation and the resulting residual errors are then used to generate residual fragments for cluster formation. The model parameters are then able to be calculated from the equations with statistical theoretical justification. We also develop a semi-automatic cluster identification method to eliminate the iterative process of manual centroid selection. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to the DPC and other clustering algorithms are demonstrated through experiments on standard benchmark datasets.

The novelty of our model is that the Physarum has six neighbours at equidistant (hexagonal CA), furthermore, we have extended the model to 3D and multi-dimensional CA grid. The growth of Physarum is determined by the balance between attraction force towards food resources (determined by mass and quality) and repulsion forces between competing Physarum according to their power (mass) and hunger motivation. To validate this model, numerical experiments were conducted. Physarum with more mass succeeded in engulfing a larger number of food resources with high quality in shorter time (number of iteration). It also occupied larger area of the grid (territory) and excluded its competitors. We also conducted empirical analysis to compare the time complexity between the hexagonal and Moore neighbourhood, and it showed that hexagonal neighbourhood is more efficient than Moore in terms of computational cost.

We adopt a data-driven approach to automatically determine the number of components of the model. In order to better extract robust features, we propose a framework of data-driven two-layer structure visual dictionary learning (DTSVDL). It works by dividing the visual dictionary structure learning into two levels: the attribute layer and the detail layer. In the attribute layer, the attributes of the image dataset are learned, and these attributes are obtained by a data-driven Bayesian nonparametric model. Then, in the detail layer, the detailed information over attributes is further explored and refined, and the attributes are weighted by the number of effective observations associated with each attribute. Our proposed approach has three main advantages: (1) the two-layer structure makes our building visual dictionary be more expressive; (2) the number of components in the attribute layer can be determined automatically from the data; (3) the components are automatically determined based on the scale of visual words; therefore, our model can well mitigate the overfitting problem. In addition, by comparing with stacked autoencoders, stacked denoising autoencoders, LeNet-5, speeded-up robust features, and pretrained deep learning model ImageNet-VGG-F algorithms, we find that our approach achieves satisfactory image categorization results on two benchmark datasets.

However, due to the openness of WSN, attackers can easily eavesdrop, intercept, and rebroadcast data packets. WSN has also faced many other security issues. Intrusion detection system (IDS) plays a pivotal part in data security protection of WSN. It can identify malicious activities that attempt to violate network security goals. Therefore, the development of effective intrusion detection technologies is very important. However, many dimensions of the datasets of IDS are irrelevant or redundant. This causes low detection speed and poor performance. Feature selection is thus introduced to reduce dimensions in IDS. At the same time, many evolutionary computing (EC) techniques were employed in feature selection. However, these techniques usually have just one Candidate Solution Generation Strategy (CSGS) and often fall into local optima when dealing with feature selection problems. The self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE) algorithm is adopted in our paper to deal with feature selection problems for IDS. The adaptive mechanism and four effective CSGSs are used in SaDE. Through this method, an appropriate CSGS can be selected adaptively to generate new individuals during evolutionary process. Besides, we have also improved the control parameters of the SaDE.

Because of its powerful global optimization ability to solve classification problems, we first present an optimization classification model in this paper. In this model, a linear equation set is constructed according to classification problems. This optimization classification model can be solved by most evolutionary computation techniques. In this research, a self-adaptive fireworks algorithm (SaFWA) is developed so that the optimization classification model can be solved efficiently. In SaFWA, four candidate solution generation strategies (CSGSs) are employed to increase the diversity of solutions. In addition, a self-adaptive search mechanism has also been introduced to use the four CSGSs simultaneously. To extensively assess the performance of SaFWA on solving classification problems, eight datasets have been used in the experiments. The experimental results show that it is feasible to solve classification problems through the optimization classification model and SaFWA.

Existing research has shown that the ABC algorithm is an effective and robust population-based method which can be used to solve various real-world optimization problems. However, similar to many evolutionary algorithms, there is still a main limitation in ABC, i.e., in many problems, ABC is good at exploration but poor at exploitation. Thus, in order to overcome this limitation and improve the performance of ABC when dealing with various kinds of optimization problems, we proposed a self-adaptive artificial bee colony algorithm with symmetry initialization (SABC-SI). In our SABC-SI algorithm, a novel population initialization method based on half space and symmetry is designed, and such method can increase the diversity of initial solutions. Besides, a self-adaptive search mechanism which is employed in ABC and several new Candidate Solution Generating Strategies (CSGSes) have also been developed. So, the evolutionary strategies cannot only be selected dynamically according to their search performance, but also be enhanced. Moreover, the selection operator is improved by eliminating a part of the poor solutions and making good use of the two best solutions in both the current and previous generations. The novel algorithm was tested on 25 different benchmark functions.

However, as well as offering opportunities to social researchers, this medium also presents a significant range of challenges. Ethical issues are one much debated area where social scientists are having to reassess their longstanding modus operandi, given questions regarding access to personal data and ambiguities regarding its status and legitimate usage. In addition, the scale of data accessible and the possible skills required to collect and analyse it is also a critical issue, and is an area that, arguably, has received lesser attention. In its infancy, online research could be fairly rudimentary, employing simple techniques to gather information from weblogs, forums and so on. However, the possibilities now presented by large-scale social media platforms has created the potential for more sophisticated research that often requires specialist technical expertise, involving collaborative work by computer and social scientists working together. This is a scenario that raises its own concerns, not least in terms of forging areas of shared understanding between these disparate disciplines sufficient to facilitate such projects. This article addresses such issues, providing a reflection on the theoretical and practical experience of engaging in online research, from fledgling involvement to embarking on a current collaborative interdisciplinary project.

It is known that some types of cancer have longer life span, and they are even curable if they are diagnosed and treated properly in the early stage. So it is essential to find biomarkers to detect these cancers in their early stages. With the rapid development of high-throughput microarray and sequencing technologies, many biomarker-based cancer early diagnosis assays are proposed and some are already available in the market. Most of the cancer biomarkers are detected through comparing cancer samples versus normal samples in a certain cancer type, but most of them are not in the comparison against other cancer types. In this research, we propose a novel computational method to comprehensively detect highly accurate cancer biomarkers for different groups of cancer types, with a special emphasis on the detection specificity against the control samples including both those from healthy persons and those from other cancer types.

Experimentally, essential proteins are identified by gene knockouts or RNA interference, which are expensive and often fatal to the target organisms. Regarding this, an alternative yet important approach to essential protein identification is through computational prediction. Existing computational methods predict essential proteins based on their relative densities in a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. Degree, betweenness, and other appropriate criteria are often used to measure the relative density. However, no matter what criterion is used, a protein is actually ordered by the attributes of this protein per se. In this research, we presented a novel computational method, Integrated Edge Weights (IEW), to first rank protein–protein interactions by integrating their edge weights, and then identified sub PPI networks consisting of those highly-ranked edges, and finally regarded the nodes in these sub networks as essential proteins.

Such communities are composed of smart devices, agents, systems and people who seek to interact in one way or another. We argue that the task of detecting anomalies in such settings is non-trivial. The complexity is further compounded since there is no clear cut definition/specification of what normal behaviour is, and how far out an outlier should be before it is detected as an anomaly. This is often the case with online and virtual spaces as there is little or no regulation of the interactions between the various players in online communities. Hence, detecting anomalous behaviour in such settings poses a huge challenge. In this paper, we investigate how evolutionary clustering could be exploited to support decision makers, designers and data scientists in the autonomous detection of anomalies in online and virtual spaces. We present preliminary ideas in tackling this issue using a freeform online social media community (Twitter) and explore how emerging patterns and trends could help identify clusters of players (or normal behaviour) and, conversely, anomalies.",  author   = "Emele, {Chukwuemeka David} and Vitalij Spakov and Wei Pang and Bone, {John David} and Coghill, {George MacLeod} and Saad Alqithami and Henry Hexmoor",  year     = "2015",  month    = may,  day      = "4",  language = "English",  type     = "Other", }

In this paper, a mode-driven discriminant analysis (MDA) in tensor subspace is proposed for visual recognition. For training, we treat each sample as an N-order tensor, of which the first N-1 modes capture the spatial information of images while the N-th mode captures the sequential patterns of images. We employ Fisher criteria on the first N-1 modes to extract discriminative features of the visual information. After that, considering the correlation of adjacent frames in the sequence, i.e., the current frame and its former and latter ones, we update the sequence by calculating the correlation of triple adjacent frames, then perform discriminant analysis on the N-th mode. The alternating projection procedure of MDA converges and is convex with different initial values of the transformation matrices. Such hybrid tensor subspace learning scheme may sufficiently preserve both discrete and continuous distributions information of action videos in lower dimensional spaces to boost discriminant power. Experiments on the MSR action 3D database, KTH database and ETH database showed that our algorithm MDA outperformed other tensor-based methods in terms of accuracy and is competitive considering the time efficiency.

However, the image vectorization of CCA breaks the spatial structure of the original image, and the excessive dimensions of vectors often cause the curse of dimensionality problem. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction method based on CCA in multi-linear discriminant subspace by encoding each action sample as a high-order tensor. An optimization approach is presented to iteratively learn the discriminant subspace by unfolding the tensor along different tensor modes, which shows that most of the underlying data structure, including the spatio-temporal information, is retained and the curse of dimensionality problem is alleviated by the use of the proposed approach. At the same time, an incremental scheme is developed for multi-linear subspace online learning, which can improve the discriminative capability efficiently and effectively.

The experiments show that it can achieve good results.",  author    = "Kangping Wang and Lan Huang and Chunguang Zhou and Wei Pang",  year      = "2004",  month     = jan,  day       = "21",  doi       = "10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259748",  language  = "English",  isbn      = "0-7803-7865-2",  booktitle = "Proceedings of the 2003 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics",  publisher = "IEEE",  address   = "United States", }
