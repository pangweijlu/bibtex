  abstract  = "Inferring dynamic system models from observed time course data is very challenging compared to static system identification tasks. Dynamic system models are complicated to infer due to the underlying large search space and high computational cost for simulation and verification. In this research we aim to infer both the structure and parameters of a dynamic system simultaneously by particle swarm optimization (PSO) improved by efficient stratified sampling approaches. More specifically, we enhance PSO with two modern stratified sampling techniques, i.e., Latin hyper cube sampling (LHS) and Latin hyper cube multi dimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). We propose and evaluate two novel swarm-inspired algorithms, LHS-PSO and LHSMDU-PSO, which can be used particularly to learn the model structure and parameters of complex dynamic systems efficiently. The performance of LHS-PSO and LHSMDU-PSO is further compared with the original PSO and genetic algorithm (GA). We chose real-world cancer biological model called Kinetochores to asses the learning performance of LHSMDU-PSO and LHS-PSO in comparison with GA and the original PSO. The experimental results show that LHSMDU-PSO can find promising models with reasonable parameters and structure, and it outperforms LHS-PSO, PSO, and GA in our experiments.",

  abstract  = "Density peak clustering (DPC) is a recently developed density-based clustering algorithm that achieves competitive performance in a non-iterative manner. DPC is capable of effectively handling clusters with single density peak (single center), i.e., based on DPC{\textquoteright}s hypothesis, one and only one data point is chosen as the center of any cluster. However, DPC may fail to identify clusters with multiple density peaks (multi-centers) and may not be able to identify natural clusters whose centers have relatively lower local density. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clustering algorithm based on a hierarchical approach, named multi-center density peak clustering (McDPC). Firstly, based on a widely adopted hypothesis that the potential cluster centers are relatively far away from each other. McDPC obtains centers of the initial micro-clusters (named representative data points) whose minimum distance to the other higher-density data points are relatively larger. Secondly, the representative data points are autonomously categorized into different density levels. Finally, McDPC deals with micro-clusters at each level and if necessary, merges the micro-clusters at a specific level into one cluster to identify multi-center clusters. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed McDPC algorithm, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets and benchmark the performance of McDPC against other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. We also apply McDPC to perform image segmentation and facial recognition to further demonstrate its capability in dealing with real-world applications. The experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance.",

We designed a deep fusion learning framework for mammographic image classification. This framework works in two main steps. After obtaining the regions of interest (ROIs) from original dataset, the first step is to train our proposed deep fusion models on those ROI patches which are randomly collected from all ROIs. We proposed the deep fusion model (Model1) to directly fuse the deep features to classify the Normal and Tumor ROI patches. To explore the association among channels of the same block, we propose another deep fusion model (Model2) to integrate the cross-channel deep features using 1 × 1 convolution. The second step is to obtain the final prediction by performing the majority voting on all patches' prediction of one ROI. The experimental results show that Model1 achieves the whole accuracy of 0.8906, recall rate of 0.913, and precision rate of 0.8077 for Tumor class. Accordingly, Model2 achieves the whole accuracy of 0.875, recall rate of 0.9565, and precision rate 0.7,586 for Tumor class.

  abstract  = "Clustering is an important unsupervised learning method in machine learning and data mining. Many existing clustering methods may still face the challenge in self-identifying clusters with varying shapes, sizes and densities. To devise a more generic clustering method that considers all the aforementioned properties of the natural clusters, we propose a novel clustering algorithm named Anchor Points based Clustering (APC). The anchor points in APC are characterized by having a relatively large distance from data points with higher densities. We take anchor points as centers to obtain intermediate clusters, which can divide the whole dataset more appropriately so as to better facilitate further grouping. In essence, based on the analysis of the identified anchor points, the relationship among the corresponding intermediate clusters can be better revealed. In short, the difference in local densities (densities within neighboring data points) of the anchor points characterizes their different properties, that is to say, all the intermediate clusters may fall into one or multiple identified levels with different densities. Finally, based on the properties of anchor points, APC spontaneously chooses the appropriate clustering strategies and reports the final clustering results. To evaluate the performances of APC, we conduct experiments on twelve two-dimensional synthetic datasets and twelve multi-dimensional real-world datasets. Moreover, we also apply APC to the Olivetti Face dataset to further assess its effectiveness in terms of face recognition. All experimental results indicate that APC outperforms four classical methods and two state-of-the-art methods in most cases.",

  abstract  = "This article presents the modeling and solution of an extended type of split delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP). In SDVRP, the demands of customers need to be met by efficiently routing a given number of capacitated vehicles, wherein each customer may be served multiple times by more than one vehicle. Furthermore, in many real-world scenarios, consumption of vehicles en route is the same as the goods being delivered to customers, such as food, water and fuel in rescue or replenishment missions in harsh environments. Moreover, the consumption may also be in virtual forms, such as time spent in constrained tasks. We name such a real-world SDVRP as Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with Goods Consumed during Transit (SDVRP-GCT). In this paper, we give mathematical formulas to model SDVRP-GCT and provide solutions by extending three ant colony algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work specifically focussing on the SDVRP-GCT problem and its solutions. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed ant colony algorithms, we first apply them on widely adopted SDVRP benchmarking instances on different scales and their correspondingly extended SDVRP-GCT instances. Then, we formulate a real-world SDVRP-GCT instance for further assessment. Based on the extensive experimental results, we discuss the pros and cons of our proposed solutions and subsequently suggest their preferable application scenarios. In summary, our proposed solutions are shown as highly efficient in solving SDVRP-GCT instances.",

This research proposes a new SVR-based regressor: v-minimum absolute deviation distribution regression (v-MADR) machine. Instead of merely minimizing structural risk, as with v-SVR, v-MADR aims to achieve better generalization performance by minimizing both the absolute regression deviation mean and the absolute regression deviation variance, which takes into account the positive and negative values of the regression deviation of sample points. For optimization, we propose a dual coordinate descent (DCD) algorithm for small sample problems, and we also propose an averaged stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for large-scale problems. Furthermore, we study the statistical property of v-MADR that leads to a bound on the expectation of error. The experimental results on both artificial and real datasets indicate that our v-MADR has significant improvement in generalization performance with less training time compared to the widely used v-SVR, LS-SVR, v-TSVR, and linear ε-SVR.

  title     = "Self-adaptive parameter and strategy based particle swarm optimization for large-scale feature selection problems with multiple classifiers",
  abstract  = "Feature selection has been widely used in classification for improving classification accuracy and reducing computational complexity. Recently, evolutionary computation (EC) has become an important approach for solving feature selection problems. However, firstly, as the datasets processed by classifiers become increasingly large and complex, more and more irrelevant and redundant features may exist and there may be more local optima in the large-scale feature space. Therefore, traditional EC algorithms which have only one candidate solution generation strategy (CSGS) with fixed parameter values may not perform well in searching for the optimal feature subsets for large-scale feature selection problems. Secondly, many existing studies usually use only one classifier to evaluate feature subsets. To show the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms for feature selection problems, more classifiers should be tested. Thus, in order to efficiently solve large-scale feature selection problems and to show whether the EC-based feature selection method is efficient for more classifiers, a self-adaptive parameter and strategy based particle swarm optimization (SPS-PSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper using multiple classifiers. In SPS-PSO, a representation scheme of solutions and five CSGSs have been used. To automatically adjust the CSGSs and their parameter values during the evolutionary process, a strategy self-adaptive mechanism and a parameter self-adaptive mechanism are employed in the framework of particle swarm optimization (PSO). By using the self-adaptive mechanisms, the SPS-PSO can adjust both CSGSs and their parameter values when solving different large-scale feature selection problems. Therefore, SPS-PSO has good global and local search ability when dealing with these large-scale problems. Moreover, four classifiers, i.e., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), extreme learning machine (ELM), and support vector machine (SVM), are individually used as the evaluation functions for testing the effectiveness of feature subsets generated by SPS-PSO. Nine datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Causality Workbench are used in the experiments. All the nine datasets have more than 600 dimensions, and two of them have more than 5,000 dimensions. The experimental results show that the strategy and parameter self-adaptive mechanisms can improve the performance of the evolutionary algorithms, and that SPS-PSO can achieve higher classification accuracy and obtain more concise solutions than those of the other algorithms on the large-scale feature problems selected in this research. In addition, feature selection can improve the classification accuracy and reduce computational time for various classifiers. Furthermore, KNN is a better surrogate model compared with the other classifiers used in these experiments.",

Clustering is an unsupervised approach that can help find new insights into biology especially for exploring the biological functions of specific cell type. However, it is challenging for traditional clustering methods to obtain high-quality cell type recognition results. In this research, we propose a novel Clustering method based on Matching Clusters Structures (MCSC) for identifying cell types among single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Firstly, MCSC obtains two different groups of clustering results from the same K-means algorithm because its initial centroids are randomly selected. Then, for one group, MCSC uses shared nearest neighbour information to calculate a label transition matrix, which denotes label transition probability between any two initial clusters. Each initial cluster may be reassigned if merging results after label transition satisfy a consensus function that maximizes structural matching degree of two different groups of clustering results. In essence, the MCSC may be interpreted as a label training process. We evaluate the proposed MCSC with five commonly used datasets and compare MCSC with several classical and state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that MCSC outperform other algorithms.",

One of the most prominent problems is traffic congestion problem. The prediction of traffic congestion is the key to alleviate traffic congestion. To ensure the real-time performance and accuracy of the traffic congestion prediction, we propose a short-term traffic congestion prediction model called TCPModel based on deep learning. By processing a massive amount of urban taxi transportation data, we extract the traffic volume and average speed of taxis which are the most important parameters for assessing of traffic flow prediction. After analyzing the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the traffic flow and average speed, we present a short-term traffic volume prediction model called TVPModel, and a short-term traffic speed prediction model called TSPModel. Both models are based on a deep learning method Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE). By comparing the other traffic flow forecasting methods and average speed forecasting methods, the methods proposed by this paper have improved the accuracy rate. For traffic congestion recognition, we use a novel model called TCPModel based on three traffic parameters (average speed, traffic flow and density), which uses standard function method to standardize the parameters and calculate the congestion comprehensive threshold to determine the congestion level by thresholds.

  abstract  = "Slime mould (Physarum) may not have brains, but they are capable of solving many significant and challenging problems. Existing models for studying the intelligent behaviour of Physarum have overlooked its foraging behaviour under competitive settings. In this research, we propose a new model based on Cellular Automata (CA) and Reaction Diffusion (RD) system, where multiple Physarum interact with each other and with their environment. The novelty of our model is that the Physarum has six neighbours at equidistant (hexagonal CA), furthermore, we have extended the model to 3D and multi-dimensional CA grid. The growth of Physarum is determined by the balance between attraction force towards food resources (determined by mass and quality) and repulsion forces between competing Physarum according to their power (mass) and hunger motivation. To validate this model, numerical experiments were conducted. Physarum with more mass succeeded in engulfing a larger number of food resources with high quality in shorter time (number of iteration). It also occupied larger area of the grid (territory) and excluded its competitors. We also conducted empirical analysis to compare the time complexity between the hexagonal and Moore neighbourhood, and it showed that hexagonal neighbourhood is more efficient than Moore in terms of computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present Physarum in competition mathematical model and the algorithms inspired from such a model has demonstrated its promising performance in solving several real world problems such as mobile wireless sensor networks, and discrete multi objective optimization problems.",

  abstract = "In recent years,heterogeneous information networks (HINs) have received a lot of attention as they contain rich semantic information.Previous works have demonstrated that the rich relationship information in HINs can effectively improve the recommendation performance.As an important tool for mining relationship information in HINs,meta-path has been widely used in many algorithms.However,because of its simple linear structure,meta-path may not be able to express complex relationship information.To address this issue,this paper proposed a new recommendation algorithm,Metastruct-CF,which applies Meta structure to capture the accurate relationship information among data objects.Different from existing methods,the proposed combines algorithm multiple relationships to effectively utilize the information in HINs.Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that this algorithm achieves better recommendation performance than several popular or state-of-the-art methods.",

  abstract  = "Missing data research is hindered by a lack in imputation evaluation techniques. Imputation has the potential to increase the impact and validity of studies from different sectors (research, public and private). By creating robust evaluation software, more researchers may be willing to use and justify using imputation methods. This paper aims to encourage further research for robust imputation evaluation by defining a framework which could be used to optimise the way we impute datasets prior to data analysis. We propose a framework which uses a prototypical approach to create testing data and machine learning methods to create a new metric for evaluation. We introduce our implementation of such a framework and present some preliminary results. The results show how, for our dataset, records with less than 40% missingness could be used for analysis, which increases the amount of available data for future studies using that dataset.",

In this research, an improved GFA with OptimalDetection (GFA-OD) is proposed for unconstrained optimizationproblems. Optimal Detection can efficiently locate the space thatmore likely contains the optimal solution(s) by initializing part ofdust population randomly in the search space of a given problem,and then improves the accuracy of solutions. The comparison ofresults on four classical unconstrained optimization problemswith varying dimensions demonstrates that the proposed GFAODoutperforms many other classical heuristic optimizationalgorithms in accuracy, efficiency and running time in lowerdimensions, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle SwarmOptimization (PSO).

  abstract = "{\textquoteleft}Big data{\textquoteright} is an area of growing research interest within sociology and numerous other disciplines. The rapid development of social media platforms and other web resources offer a vast and readily accessible repository of data associated with participants{\textquoteright} activities, attitudes and personal information on a scale and depth that would have previously been difficult to access without substantial resources. However, as well as offering opportunities to social researchers, this medium also presents a significant range of challenges. Ethical issues are one much debated area where social scientists are having to reassess their longstanding modus operandi, given questions regarding access to personal data and ambiguities regarding its status and legitimate usage. In addition, the scale of data accessible and the possible skills required to collect and analyse it is also a critical issue, and is an area that, arguably, has received lesser attention. In its infancy, online research could be fairly rudimentary, employing simple techniques to gather information from weblogs, forums and so on. However, the possibilities now presented by large-scale social media platforms has created the potential for more sophisticated research that often requires specialist technical expertise, involving collaborative work by computer and social scientists working together. This is a scenario that raises its own concerns, not least in terms of forging areas of shared understanding between these disparate disciplines sufficient to facilitate such projects. This article addresses such issues, providing a reflection on the theoretical and practical experience of engaging in online research, from fledgling involvement to embarking on a current collaborative interdisciplinary project. The aim is to provide some insights to other social scientists with respect to some of the potential advantages and pitfalls of web research, while a flavour of the current project, exploring Scottish Referendum and UK General Election related Twitter data, is also presented.",

To perform this kind of simulation, we rst recasttwo integration methods, which were originally used in traditional numerical simulation,and made them suitable for performing interval simulation in a non-constructive man-ner. Then we proposed an iterative interval narrowing algorithm to control the growth ofintervals during simulation. To achieve better accuracy and eciency of the simulation,we designed several simulation modes to meet dierent requirements of various problems.The proposed simulation algorithm was theoretically studied in terms of its completeness,soundness, convergence, and stability. Finally two classical dynamic systems, as well asan electrical circuit model containing an algebraic loop, were used as test examples todemonstrate the validity of the proposed simulation approach.",

QML-Morven is an extensible framework and currently includes three QML subsystems, which employ either symbolic or evolutionary approachesas their learning strategies. QML-Morven uses the formalism of Morven, a fuzzy qualitative simulator, to represent and reason about qualitative models, and it also utilisesMorven to verify candidate models. Based on this framework, a series of experiments weredesigned and carried out to: (1) verify the results obtained by the previous QML systemILP-QSI; (2) investigate factors that in¿uence the learning precision and minimum datarequirement for successful learning; (3) address the scalability issue of QML systems.",

Multi-port Container Stowage (MPCS) is a more practical problem. However, multi-port makes the container stowage problem more difficult. This paper presents a MPCS model based on time series and a multi-agent ERA model based on belief to solve the multi-port container stowage problem. The algorithm introduces the belief concept into agents and creates a multi-agent ERA model. The searching direction and strength of the agents are determined by the learning machine using belief parameter. Agent has the ability to evaluate its searching path. At last, the feasibility and efficiency of the model are validated by the experimental result.",
